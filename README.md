# TS Lessons

A collection of my practice code while learning **TypeScript**.  
This repository contains examples of basic TypeScript concepts with simple implementations.

## Topics Covered
- **Type Annotations** – Defining variables with types (`number`, `string`, etc.)  
- **Arrays & Tuples** – Working with typed arrays and fixed-length tuples  
- **Enums** – Using `enum` and `const enum` for predefined values  
- **Functions** – Adding parameter and return types, default values  
- **Objects & Type Aliases** – Creating custom types and enforcing type safety  
- **Readonly Properties** – Protecting object properties from modification  
- **Literal Types** – Restricting values with union literal types  
- **Optional Chaining** – Safely accessing nested or optional properties  

## Purpose
This repo is mainly for learning and practicing TypeScript fundamentals.  
It will gradually grow as I cover more advanced concepts.
